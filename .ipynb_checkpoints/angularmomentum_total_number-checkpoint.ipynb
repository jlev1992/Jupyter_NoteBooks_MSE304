    "\n",
    "An electron has orbital angular momentum $L$ and spin angular momentum $S$. In general, both are present simultaneously and a total angular momentum, called $J$, is introduced. This total angular momentum is also associated with a quantum number $j$, for which holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "J^2 = \\hbar^2j(j+1)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "j = |l \\pm s|\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If an electron is in the $n_{s}$, $n_{p}$, $n_{d}$, or $n_{f}$ state (one of these will be given in the problem), how many $j$ are associated with each and what is the highest total angular momentum quantum number $j$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: $l=0,1,2,3$ for s, p, d, and f orbitals. There are two $j$ per $l$, as $s$ takes the value $-1/2$ or $1/2$. The highest is simply $l+1/2$."
