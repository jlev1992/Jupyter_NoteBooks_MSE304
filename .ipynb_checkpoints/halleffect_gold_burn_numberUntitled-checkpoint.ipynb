    "Problem statement: How long would it take for a current of $I=10$ A to melt the gold film by Joule heating if 75% of the heat dissipated in the film is conducted away by cooling the substrate? A new film with thickness $t$ μm is used, s (length and width of films) are still 1 mm. Pure gold melts at 1064∘C and has a specific heat capacity $c_p$ of 0.129 J/(gK) at a room temperature of 25∘C. The resistivity of gold is $r=2.44\\times 10^{−8}$ Ωm.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's establish how much power is supplied by a current according to Ohm's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P_{supplied} = I^2R\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "R is the resitance, and is given by the $R = rL/A$ where $L$ is the material length and $A$ is the area through which the current is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, 75% of the supplied power is taken away by subtrait cooling, and thus the supplied power changes to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P_{supplied} = 0.25*I^2R\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Thermal required power to change heat $\\Delta Q$ per change in time $\\Delta t$ are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P_{required} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a given change in temperature $\\Delta T$ and a specific heat capacity $c_p$ is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "c_{p} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta T}\\frac{1}{m}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $m$ is the mass of material being heated. We can rewrite mass in terms of material density volume $m = \\rho V$ and then solve for the suppled heat $\\Delta Q$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta Q = \\rho V c_p \\Delta T\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the power required to heat the material by $\\Delta T$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "P_{required} = \\frac{\\rho V c_p \\Delta T}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can set the supplied power equal to the required power to induce the heating:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "0.25*I^2 R = \\frac{\\rho V c_p \\Delta T}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the time required to change the material temperature by $\\Delta T$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Delta t  = \\frac{\\rho V c_p \\Delta T}{0.25*I^2 R}\n",
