    "Problem Statement: The set of all transitions from higher energy states into a given energy state of a hydrogen atom is called a series. You will investigate the Paschen series, which corresponds to all transitions from higher levels into n=3.\n",

    "What is the wave length range of the Paschen series?\n",

    "Solution: The lowest energy levels ($n=1$) of hydrogen is situated at -13.6 eV. For $n=3$, the state energy  is $E_{n=3}=-1.511$ eV. The first energy transiton down into $n=3$ can occur from $n=4$, where $E_{n=4}=-0.85$ eV. Thus, lowest transitions $E_{n=4}-E_{n=3}=0.661111$ eV, associated with 1875.39 nm light. Now, as $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, $E_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}=0$ eV. Thus, $E_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}-E_{n=3}=1.511$ eV, associated with 820.48 nm light. \n",
