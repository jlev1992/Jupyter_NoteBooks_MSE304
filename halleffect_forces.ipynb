    "An electron with speed $v_x$ (towards the right of the page, x-direction) enters a region that is $h$ wide (in the y-direction). The region contains a uniform $B$ magentic field directed into the page (in the z-direction). What is the magnitude of the applied voltage in the y-direction that must be used to ensure that the electron hits the center of the target (remains on a straight path)?\n",
