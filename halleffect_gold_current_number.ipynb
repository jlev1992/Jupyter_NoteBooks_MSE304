    "Problem Statement: Suppose your voltmeter can only measure voltages with an accuracy of $V_H$ μV. What current would you have to pass through the film to detect a change in magnetic field of the magnitude $B_z$ T. The side length $s$ in mm and thickness $t$ is in μm.\n",

    "The first order of business is to find the electron concentration $n$. We know that each atom of gold gives one free electron. The density of gold $\\rho=19300$ kg/m^3. The atomic mass is given as $M=0.197$ kg/mol. Finally, we know Avogadro's number is $\\alpha=6.022\\times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol. Let's calculate the number of electrons per cubic meter:"
