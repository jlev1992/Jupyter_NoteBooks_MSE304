    "$V_H=IB/(ten)$, where $t$ is the thickness of the film. If the current through the film is held constant at 100 mA, what is the magnetic field that can be recorded per $\\mu V$ of Hall voltage? Assume each gold atom contributes one conduction electron. \n",

    "The first order of business is to find the electron concentration $n$. We know that each atom of gold gives one free electron. The density of gold $\\rho=19300$ kg/m^3. The atomic mass is given as $M=0.197$ kg/mol. Finally, we know Avogadro's number is $\\alpha=6.022\\times 10^{23}$ atoms/mol. Let's calculate the number of electrons per cubic meter:"
