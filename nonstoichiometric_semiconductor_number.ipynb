    "In a reducing atmosphere, the oxygen ion in TiO<sub>2</sub> will be reduced and leak out, leaving behind oxygen vacancies and free electrons, and TiO<sub>2</sub> will become a n-type semiconductor. The defect reaction equation is as follows (the superscript \".\" means negative charge, and \"Ã—\" means positive charge, with respect to the lattice ion).\n",
