    "Electrons in a nanowire (NW) can often be treated as 1-dimensional, since they are strongly confined in two dimensions and can only move in the remaining dimension. Consider an isolated NW of length L nm with one free electron (assume the other electrons are tightly bound to their atoms and donâ€™t play a role). The electron cannot leave the NW, hence, we describe the NW by an infinite square well potential given by:\n",

    "V = infinity outside of these bounds.\n",

    "Give the infinite well boundary conditions, we know both real and imaginary parts of the WF at L/2 must be 0."
